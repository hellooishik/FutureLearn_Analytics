# FutureLearn_Analytics

Welcome to ProjectTemplate!

This file introduces you to ProjectTemplate, but you should eventually replace
the contents of this file with an introduction to your project. People who
work with your data in the future will thank you for it, including your future
self.

ProjectTemplate is an R package that helps you organize your statistical
analysis projects. Since you're reading this file, we'll assume that you've
already called `create.project()` to set up this project and all of its
contents.

To load your new project, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the directory
where this README file is located. Then you need to run the following two
lines of R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

Steps to run the project:

1. Open the FutureLearn_Analytics.Rproj file
2. Run renv::restore()
3. Run load.project()
4. Cleaned data is stored in Cache/
5. Analysis code is in Report/analysis.Rmd
